# General Guidelines

- Don't include any superfluous PHP Annotations, except ones that start with `@` for typing variables.
- Every time you create a new file, stage it immediately with `git add <path>`. Never commit; leave committing to the user.
- Do not write browser tests (`tests/Browser`, Pest browser plugin, Playwright). Cover behavior with Feature and Unit tests only.
